### About
This app uses Ajax with the Giphy API to show the first 10 gifs that come up when the specified food is searched for on Giphy. The label for the input field says "Add a food" but input is not limited to foods. New gifs load above previously loaded gifs.

### How to use
Click on a button to view 10 gifs related to the food label of the button and their associated ratings (ex. G, PG). Click on an individual gif to pause or animate the gif. Add your own button with the input field on the right.
